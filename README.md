# Thin Layer Placement, Greay Bay, NH
Extensive effort is dedicated towards restoring critical habitats, 
such as salt marshes and mangroves, but we largely exclude microbial 
communities as part of these plans, despite the significant role they 
play in mediating biogeochemical cycles we seek to restore. In this work, 
we are monitoring microbial responses to restoration to better understand 
and identify restoration success.

## Project goal
To explore microbial community structure and assembly over time following
thin layer sediment placement in 2023. 

## Who to contact
This work is led by Ph.D. candidate Marjorie Mednikova in Dr. Gregg Moore's 
lab group at the University of New Hampshire.
